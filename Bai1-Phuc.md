# Can carnival be saved?

Carnival is a time of cultural exuberance. In the Low Countries, however, the masquerade has become a refuge for dominant groups to caricature the heritage and bodies of others. Where does this propensity come from? And can it be changed?

It’s post-carnival, but any hangovers in the Low Countries today aren’t a mark of the usual physical overindulgence. This year’s carnival festivities were cancelled. Yet questions still remain about last year’s mayhem and the celebration’s cultural leftovers.

Carnival 2020 resulted in an initial northern European coronavirus hotspot. As the healthcare system in Bergamo collapsed, those who had only just returned from their skiing holidays in Italy decided to celebrate carnival in North Brabant. They simply could not miss the annual event: the fun of people closely packed together, the beer, the carnival songs easy to holler along to, the gaudy costumes.

Now, the decision to seek out more crowds after having just visited a hotspot would raise many questions. However, at the time, it was somewhat dismissed – political leaders in the Netherlands even encouraged people to go out and party.

The outbreak that followed in North Brabant was initially largely ignored by the rest of the Netherlands. Its occurrence south of the rivers made it seem as though it was happening in another country – at least according to those at the nodes of newsgathering and public opinion. A racist carnival song even appeared in the Netherlands that linked the virus’s outbreak to dining in Chinese restaurants instead of skiing in the Alps – and people call this humour.

Carnival songs have recently been in the news more often in the Netherlands than I am used to in the Caribbean and not because they ridicule the dominant group. These songs treat different groups and individuals disparagingly based on their race. Dutch politician, actor and presenter Sylvana Simons, for example, was once pressured to ‘pack her bags’ because of her criticism of racism within the Netherlands. The song was followed by a lynching video. Although carnival seems to be an increasing cover for racism, it could also be the means of liberation from that racism.
