# The Antillean carnival

The Antillean carnival demonstrates that carnival can be a celebration of liberation. After all, the festival’s experience in North Brabant is indeed different from that on the island of St. Maarten, where I grew up. There, it developed after liberated Indigenous peoples emphatically changed the context of that previously hosted by European colonists. While for the islands’ white elite carnival was initially an exclusive party with masks, various groups took the form, imitated elements and supplemented it with local rituals, reflections and African rhythms – adaptations that the plantation owners had always forbidden. Only after the anti-colonial uprising of 30 May 1969 was carnival officially allowed on Curaçao. Now, it is an indispensable part of the region. Going as a child to Carnival Village on the Pondfill in St. Maarten’s Philipsburg was more than a family outing – it was a way to watch a community celebrate its diversity.

However, few people know or remember that the first Antillean carnival in the Netherlands was organized in 1982. The prices of airline tickets to the islands that the Dutch had colonized and occupied became so expensive due to the oil crisis that the Antillean community in the Netherlands decided to organize its own version. In 1982, groups from Den Helder to Tilburg went to the Antillean carnival in centrally located Utrecht hosted by cultural association Kibra Hacha.

Kibra Hacha, named after a Caribbean tree that only blossoms once a year, unites members who, for various reasons, arrived in the Netherlands from Curaçao, Aruba, Bonaire, St. Maarten, St. Eustatius and Saba. When I went to study in Utrecht in 2002, I took part in the association’s orientation week in a suburb called Zuilen; the centre had already been driven from the city centre due to rent hikes. Since then, Kibra Hacha has also lost that location and its Facebook page has been inactive since 2011.
